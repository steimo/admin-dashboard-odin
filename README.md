# Admin Dashboard:

My solution to the [the assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/intermediate-html-and-css/lessons/admin-dashboard) where the main goal was to build an admin dashboard using Grid for the majority of the layout work. The project was not meant to be responsive but the cards section expands or shrinks when resizing the browser window.

## Resources used:
- 'Roboto' font which is available with Google fonts under Apache License. For all text in the project.
- SVGs for all of the icons from ['Material Design Icons'.](https://materialdesignicons.com/)
- Bender character pic icon by [Icons8](https://icons8.com/)
